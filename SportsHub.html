        <p class="Details ">The 34-year-old Argentine international opened the scoring and set up another goal in Juve's 3-0 victory over Sassuolo on Monday before he was withdrawn in the 66th minute. 
        Juventus forward Angel Di Maria suffered a thigh muscle injury on his Serie A debut and will out of action for at least 10 days, the Turin-based club said on Tuesday.
        The 34-year-old Argentine international opened the scoring and set up another goal in Juve’s 3-0 victory over Sassuolo on Monday before he was withdrawn in the 66th minute.
        “Di Maria underwent scans this morning … which revealed a low-grade lesion of the adductor longus muscle of the left thigh,” Juventus said on their website. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/di-maria-sidelined-with-injury-after-juve-debut-8094278/">See more...</a>

        <p class="Details ">England test captain Ben Stokes says he hopes his team has retained their “venom” ahead of the start of the three-match series against South Africa which begins at Lord’s on Wednesday.
        There has been a lot of chatter about England’s attacking style of play, nicknamed ‘Bazball’ because of new coach Brendon McCullum, that swept them to four wins in a row in June-July, each time successfully 
        chasing over 275 to win against New Zealand and India. South Africa skipper Dean Elgar suggested England’s all-out attack with the bat was unsustainable and would eventually see them fail, but Stokes says the 
        die has been cast and they will not waiver from their plans. “The opposition seems to be doing a lot of the talking at the moment about it,” Stokes told reporters on Tuesday. “We just concentrate on what 
        we do. We’ve got a style of play, they’ve got a style of play. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/stokes-wants-england-to-stick-to-their-guns-over-bazball-8093933/">See more...</a></p>

        <p class="Details ">After a long wait, football season is back again with a unique twist this time around. This year, every major league in the world will hit the pause button during November 20-December 18 as the World Cup comes calling. Basically, the season will be divided into 2 halves, before the World Cup and after the World Cup, which can prove pivotal in the long run. It will be interesting to see how the clubs cope with the scenario after their star players come back after a long international tournament and if it affects their rhythm in the league.
        After another game week is done and dusted, here’s a look at the points tables and the top scorers of some of the top leagues in the world, namely the English Premier League, The Spanish La Liga and the Italian Serie A. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/english-premier-league-epl-spanish-la-liga-italian-serie-a-points-table-and-top-scorers-8093082/">See more...</a></p>
